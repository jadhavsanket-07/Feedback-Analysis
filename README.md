# Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

The **Sentiment Analysis** project aims to analyze customer reviews for a restaurant using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By employing machine learning algorithms, this project classifies reviews as positive or negative based on the textual content. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, providing insights into customer sentiment.

## Purpose

In the competitive restaurant industry, understanding customer feedback is crucial for improving service quality and customer satisfaction. This project serves to:

- **Enhance Customer Experience**: Analyze customer reviews to identify areas for improvement and enhance overall dining experiences.
- **Support Decision Making**: Provide restaurant management with actionable insights based on customer sentiment.
- **Monitor Brand Reputation**: Track customer perceptions and sentiments over time to maintain a positive brand image.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess customer reviews by removing noise, converting text to lowercase, and stemming words.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilize the Bag of Words model to convert text data into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Training**: Implement various Naive Bayes classifiers (Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Multinomial) to classify reviews.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLTK**
